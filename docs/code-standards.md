# Code Standards

Mandatory standards for every feature. These make the project correct, maintainable, and reviewable.

## Python (backend & chess AI)

- Follow PEP 8.
- Type hints on public functions and domain interfaces.
- Ruff for linting and formatting; mypy (or Pyright) for type checking.
- pytest for unit and integration tests; Hypothesis for property-based tests.
- Keep chess search algorithms independent of FastAPI routes and database code.
- Avoid circular imports; no broad exception suppression.
- Descriptive names, focused functions, explicit error handling.

## TypeScript + React (frontend)

- TypeScript `strict` mode; avoid `any`.
- Use discriminated unions for game modes and states.
- ESLint and Prettier; Vitest + React Testing Library.
- Functional components; small, reusable modules.
- Keep API access out of presentation components.
- Validate external input at runtime; avoid duplicated sources of truth.
- Handle loading, failure, and empty states explicitly.

## PostgreSQL (data)

- Alembic migrations only (no `create_all` in production).
- Foreign keys, unique constraints, and indexes on lookup/ownership columns.
- Transactions for move submission and game-state updates.
- Never store plaintext passwords; never commit secrets.
- Keep database queries out of chess-engine algorithms.

## Code quality principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Single responsibility | Each module has one clear job |
| DRY | Reuse genuinely shared logic; no premature abstractions |
| KISS | Simplest design that meets requirements |
| Explicit contracts | Type hints, API schemas, clear signatures |
| Fail safely | Validate moves, inputs, permissions, engine limits |
| Testability | Core logic testable without starting the whole app |
| Maintainability | Descriptive names, short functions, focused modules |
| Security by default | Validate inputs, protect sessions, enforce ownership |

## Naming conventions

| Item | Convention | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Python files/functions | snake_case | `search_position.py` |
| Python classes | PascalCase | `ChessEngine` |
| TS variables/functions | camelCase | `submitMove` |
| React components | PascalCase | `ChessBoard.tsx` |
| Constants | UPPER_SNAKE_CASE | `MAX_SEARCH_DEPTH` |
| API routes | lowercase, plural | `/api/v1/games` |
| DB tables | snake_case, consistent | `game_moves` |
| Test files | descriptive | `test_move_validation.py` |

## Layering (the example)

Bad — HTTP, rules, AI, and DB in one endpoint:

```python
@app.post("/move")
def move(data: dict):
    # validate, update board, search AI move, save to DB here
    ...
```

Good — responsibilities separated:

```python
def submit_move(game: Game, move_uci: str, rules: ChessRules) -> Game:
    move = rules.parse_legal_move(game.position, move_uci)
    return game.apply_move(move)
```

The API layer validates and calls the service; the service uses the rules adapter; a repository persists the result in a transaction.

## Definition of clean code

A feature is clean when it: follows naming/formatting; has explicit types and validated inputs; keeps business logic separate from UI/API/persistence; handles expected errors without hiding them; includes tests for normal and edge cases; passes quality gates; avoids unnecessary dependencies and duplication; and documents any deliberate shortcut with a repayment trigger.
